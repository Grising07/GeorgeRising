    "in programming i have enjoyed learning various tools, i prefer working in an environment with many people around me. this is because i can look around to get help of others as programming is always easier when working with others. This is because i can get their opinions and ideas on things that maybe i didn't think of. this can speed up the process of programming as i dont have to sit there and think about it by myself for a long time. i feel like it helps me bond with people while i am working out programs because it feels good after completing  challenge together.\n",
